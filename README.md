# PythonProject-PhishingDiscovery

## Aim of the project
The aim of this project was to use different machine learning methods to determine whether a website is a phishing website or not. After implementation of the methods we will use different methods to check the results. We have chosen three different methods to compare how they perform with the same task. The methods we chose were Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree
